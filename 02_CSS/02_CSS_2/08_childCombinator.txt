Child Combinator 
Eg : Selects all buttons which are direct childrens of spans 

span > button {
    property : value ;
}



What is the difference between Child Combinator and Descendant Selector 

1) Child Combinator ('>') 
 The Child Combinator selects only the immediate children of a particular element 
 It will not select grandchildren or elemeent at deeper levels in the hierarchy; only the direct children 

2) Descendant Selector (' ')
 The Descendant selector selects all the element that are Descendant of a specifies element , regardless how deeper they are nested.
 It does not matter if the element are direct children or nestes deeper in the hierarchy



 Child : Only 1 level deep we can go using Child Combinator

 # We use Descendant Selector more than Child Combinator
