CSS : Cascading StyleSheets 

What is cascade in CSS ? 
The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS Properties .

Example : 
h2{
    background-color:yellow;
}

h2{
    background-color:blue;
}

The Final Color will be Blue . It's like what is written at end will work . This also means if you have include more than 1 css file . than the last file work will be done . 



Selector Specificity 
What is Specificity ? 
Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration .


Practice :

For the given HTML,CSS Code . What is the bg-color of p ? 
<div>
    <p class = "para"> This is a Paragraph. </p>
</div>

div p {
    background-color : black;           :  Descendant Selector 0 0 2 
}
.para{
    background-color : blue;            :  Class Selector  0 1 0 
}
p{
    background-color : green;           :  Element Selector 0 0 1 
}

So Blue Color wins .
