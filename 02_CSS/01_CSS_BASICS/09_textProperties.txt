Text Properties : 

text-align 
font-weight
text-decoration 
line-height
letter-spacing 
font-size 


text-align property with refrence to Parent Element 

text-align : left/start 
text-align : right/end 
text-align : center 
text-align : justify 

Why the concept of start / end came in CSS 3 ? 
See Some languages start from left to right and some langauge start from right to left . Like Arabic : Right to Left 
So, it makes sense if you are making website for more than 1 languages . 
left : start 
right : end 

For justify : horizontal left boundary and vertical right boundary looks similar 


font-weight property

font-weight : normal   //400 
font-weight : bold     //700 
font-weight : 100 

//These 2 used according to parent elements 
font-weight : bolder 
font-weight : lighter 


text-decoration :  sets the appearance of decorative lines 

text-decoration : underline 
text-decoration : overline 
text-decoration : line-through

We can also use styles in text-decoration 
text-decoration : red underline
text-decoration : wavy overline 
text-decoration : dotted line-through 

#imp 
In Anchor tag : the default line comes blue color . So text decoration is mainly use to customize that thing. 



Line Height Property : controls the height of the line of text.

line-height : normal 
line-height : 2.5   

2.5 means 2.5 * normal 




letter-spacing : controls the horizontal spacing behaviour between text character .

letter-spacing : normal 
letter-spacing : 10px (px : pixel)


font-family : specifies a priortised list of one or more font family names 
font-family : arial 
We usually write list of font-family . this works as a backup if anything does not work than different font-family is used
