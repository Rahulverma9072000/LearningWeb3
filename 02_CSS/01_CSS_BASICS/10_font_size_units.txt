Font-size Units in CSS 

Absolute           Relative 

px                 %
pt                 em 
pc                 rem 
cm                 ch
mm                 vh 
in                 vw + many more 


1 in = 96px 
72pt = 1 in 
12pt  = 1pc 

We mostly use : px in Absolute , %,em,rem in Relative 

Remember this : 1 inch = 96px 
px is fixed whether its desktop screen , ipad , laptop screen so we generally dont use px . 
Responsiveness of the website can't be achieved using px .
