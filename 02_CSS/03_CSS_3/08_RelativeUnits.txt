PErcentage (%)
It is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object.
Child element ki property ko fix krna hai parent ki property se tab % use krte hai . 
eg : width : 33.33% //relative to the parent 
margin-left : 50%  //relative to the parent size 


Em :
Font-size of the parent , in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font-size of the elements itself , in the case of other properties like width . 


Drawbacks of Em : 
Snowball effect in nested elements : By nesting it multiplies the size or any property to great extent .  

So to avoid this Drawback : we use rem 
Rem ( Root Em) : Font size of the root element . 

section -> div -> div -> div 
So the root will be section for all div .
