Strings are text or sequence of characters 

let name = "Tony Stark";
let role = "ironMan";
let char = 'a';
let num = '23';
let empty = "";

typeof char 
> 'string'


There should be fix format for using ' , " 
for Single char : Use ' 
for Multiple characters : Use "

Use different for printing quotes 
let sentence = 'This is "Apple"';
let sentence = 'This is 'Apple'";

But if you use same quotes bcoz it got confuse than it give error 
let sentence = 'This is 'Apple'';



String Indices 

let name = "TONY STARK";
//internally every char will get some position 
//O based indexing 
name[0] -> 'T'
name[1] -> 'O'

//If you access the character that is not present or outside the length of the string 
-> Undefined

name.length
> 10 
typeof name.length
> number 
name[name.length-1]
> 'K'
"Rahul"[0]
> 'R'

Concatenation : adding strings together 
"tony" + " " + "stark"
> 'tony stark'
